Pipeline.py is used to create a pipeline.yaml file, which specifies the components of our pipeline. The pipeline can be executed simply by pressing the run button, and it is self-contained. It should be noted that the pipeline is tested on Google Cloud, not IBM Cloud. 

The serve.yaml file is used to deploy the service to an endpoint.

Our deployed endpoint is
http://34.121.84.159:82/
