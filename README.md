# Cloud and Machine Learning CSCI-GA.3033-085
In this project, we demonstrate the
deployment of the neural style transfer application
on the Kubeflow Platform to create an end-to-
end machine learning pipeline application. Our
approach conducted all the computations on the
Google Cloud Platform, alleviating the workload
requirements on the userâ€™s machine, while also
generated graphics of higher quality and faster
than existing implementations in real-time.



pipeline.py is used to create a pipeline.yaml file, which specifies the components of our pipeline. The pipeline can be executed simply by pressing the run button, and it is self-contained. It should be noted that the pipeline is tested on Google Cloud Platform, not IBM Cloud. 

## To create yaml file
```
python pipeline.py
```
This will create the pipeline.yaml file using Kubeflow Pipelines SDK package

## Create our pipeline
Create an Experiment environment on Kubeflow dashboard, then upload our pipeline.yaml there to run. 

## Deploy to endpoint
The serve.yaml file is used to deploy the service to a public endpoint.

After connecting to the Kubeflow Cluster on your CLI, simply apply the script:

```
kubectl apply -f serve.yaml
```


Our deployed endpoint is

http://df45f84b-eu-gb.lb.appdomain.cloud:8001/

http://34.121.84.159:82/
