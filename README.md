# project2
pipeline.py is used to create a pipeline.yaml file, which specifies the components of our pipeline. The pipeline can be executed simply by pressing the run button, and it is self-contained. It should be noted that the pipeline is tested on Google Cloud, not IBM Cloud. 

## Create our pipeline
upload our pipeline to Kubeflow dashboard and run. 

## Deploy to endpoint
The serve.yaml file is used to deploy the service to an endpoint.

Our deployed endpoint is
http://34.121.84.159:82/
